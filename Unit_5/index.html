<h2> It all started back in high school... </h2>
<p>I was 15 when I started working for my first publication, "Oread", the Burlington High School yearbook. I guess you could say that that was the first time I fell in love. Watching our book come together, after weeks of planning was more rewarding for me than anything I had ever done before. It was then that I wanted to pursue a career in journalism. </p>
